        <p>An online open meeting for local residents was held via the meeting platform Teams on 21st April
            2021, where the Secretary set out the group’s aims and the ultimate goal of securing the future of
            The White Horse through community purchase.
            It was at this meeting that a proposed
            framework and action plan (including the offering of community shares and bid to the
            government’s Community Ownership Fund) was presented and discussed. This meeting was
            followed by a two-week initial consultation period, when community members were issued with a
            consultation questionnaire in order to gauge the community’s appetite for community ownership
            of the pub, including interest in purchasing community shares. Members of the community were
            asked if (and why) the pub was important to them, their views on community ownership of the
            pub, and what services they would like to see made available.
            The consultation responses also demonstrated that many households and individuals in the village
            and surrounding areas are genuinely interested in investing in the pub. The opportunity to ‘pledge
            in principle’ for community shares received an extremely positive response and resulted in pledges
            totaling a value of over £150,000.

        <p><strong>Describe your fundraising activities</strong></p>

        <p>Our funding will come from a number of sources, a community share offer will look to raise
        £230,000 (this is achievable given the experience of other similar size and position community
        pubs). Additional match funding (£230,000) will be applied for through the Community Ownership
        Fund (COF). Other grants, donations and fundraising will be also sought.</p>
